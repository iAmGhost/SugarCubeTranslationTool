Translation tool for Sugar Cube: Bittersweet Factory.

I made this application for translating Sugar Cube:BF to Korean.

Edit scripts/lang.lua for create own translation.

Too lazy to write down english strings, just open original images(/Data/Image) for original strings.

Note: This application doesn't have any content from Sugar Cube:BF, you'll need to buy it.

Go http://www.turtle-cream.com/ and get some sugars.
